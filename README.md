# My Portfolio

Design was not a priority. Putting in practice part of what I learned about Next JS. Dividing my life into stages and things I feel proud of, see my evolution as a human.

## Features

- Pages are being statically pre-rendered
- Using CSS global variables and reusing them all around the app
- CSS modules to avoid styles from clashing.
- NextJS + CSS modules + React.
